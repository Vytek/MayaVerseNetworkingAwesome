List of all Networking Resources for Metaverse

Reference: https://gitlab.com/Juankz/realtime-network-sync-godot/raw/master/README.md
If you want to learn games networking properly I recommend the book [Multiplayer Game Programming: Architecting Networked Games](https://www.amazon.com/Multiplayer-Game-Programming-Architecting-Networked/dp/0134034309) by Joshua Gazler and Sanjay madhav.

This demo itself takes inspiration from the GDC talk [Networking for physics programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9X4lysFr64) by Glenn Fieddler and the [Fast-Paced Multiplayer article series](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html) by Gabriel Gambetta.
